I was always just a kid from Brooklyn, and the way it shaped me certainly left a mark which has never faded to this day. Being the sickly, scrawny kid that I was it was definitely not a matter of determination and following a specific path, like most of us I was scrambling for some purpose and validation. I thought better to die on that road than to just do nothing.

## Growing up feeling down

Both my parents had died by the time I was a teen, My dad too early for me to remember, but my mom managed to leave a strong impression on me before she left - having to take care of her also meant spending a lot of quality time with her. Having to lose one’s parents in a time of war and depression could easily get somebody twisted on the inside but I just wanted to do something significant as part of my mom’s legacy.

I needed a guiding compass to help me stay upright through my teen years, what I did have was a strong sense of helping others, and oddly enough no fear of dying. I had to make ends meet while I was on my own and being an artist was a humble but satisfying way to do that, but once I heard about drafts for the war I felt like this was my chance: I could use the life I was given to serve my entire country, or at least die in the fight for justice. My application was rejected. Then it was rejected again. Apparently my weak disposition meant that I didn’t have the right to fight for the justice I believed in.

## To be warriors, not soldiers

We tend to have this idea that good and justice are selfless, that a hero is someone who sacrifices something for the sake of others. A selfless act is not a noble one. I wanted to become a soldier in the military because I believed they were the real heroes among men, but in my short experience they didn’t care about justice, just about winning. The ultimate act of seflessness is to be a soldier without a will of your own, to be ordered by weaker men to carry out whatever fits their agenda.

The idea of heroes stemmed from warriors who faught for a cause they personally believed in, even if it was just greatness. The most persistent cause is a selfish one because it’s not conditional on your circumstances, especially not on receiving a reward. Here, the pursuit of justice itself has to be a source of personal joy and happiness, so even if the whole world turns against you you can’t lose your way.

For those on the frontlines they do risk or lose a lot of precious things and it’s noble of them to be able to carry on in spite of it, but they’re not to be pitied, it’s a privilege to be able to achieve nobility and heroism. Today, most of the warriors aren’t in an army, but they can become great heroes nonetheless. Celebrate them, not as sacrifices, but as inspirations.
